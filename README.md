_doc-metrix_ provides documentation and utilities for computer metrics.


## Overview

Evaluating computer performance requires a detailed understanding of computer metrics. While system and activity monitors available on most commodity PCs provide basic windows into computer performance, information about how metrics are calculated is sparse and often buried away in forums and technical guides. Furthermore, the number of metrics exposed to end users through graphical user interfaces is a fraction of the number of metrics being collected. Accessing these (hidden) metrics often requires 1) familiarity with kernels and the underlying file system and 2) a willingess to dig through `man` pages to unearth a metric's meaning and its derivation.

We believe understanding computer performance metrics, their origins, derivation, and relevance, should not be a herculean task. Our aim is to provide sensible documentation along with utilities to easily query metric information.
